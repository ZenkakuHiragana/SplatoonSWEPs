This addon provides a set of water guns, which can actually paint around the world and soak other players.  
If you are interested in this project, watch this the following video for a brief introduction.

> [!CAUTION]  
> Many features seen in the video are disabled.  I will add them again in the future.

The aim of this rework is the following:

* Working fine on multiplayer game (especially on dedicated servers)
* Various options!
  * Drawing crosshair
  * Left hand mode
  * DOOM-style viewmodel
  * Aim down sight toggle/hold
  * And so on...

## Important thing - read before testing

***
**I don't intend to let you enjoy the new SWEPs.  Actually I want you to test it to help me fix bugs.**  
**So, I think something like "The addon isn't working for me" isn't worth reading.**  
**If you're going to tell me you're in trouble, go to Issues page and follow the template.**  

* [ ] What happened to you? Write the detail.
* [ ] How to get the same problem? The "step to reproduce" section.
* [ ] Any errors?  If so, the message in the console.
* [ ] Your environment (OS, Graphics card, and so on).
* [ ] Addons in your game - Some of them may conflict. Please specify the one.  
      **Something like "I have 300+ addons" isn't helpful.**

## Known issues

* Loading some large maps with this SWEPs causes GMOD to crash in 32-bit build.
    You can still load them in 64-bit build so I recommend to switch to it.
* You may experience major frame drops if your VRAM amount is not enough.
    Make sure to set the ink resolution option (found in where you change playermodel for the SWEPs) correctly.
* If you see errors on map load and can't paint at all, try removing cache files.
    * They are located in `garrysmod/data/splashsweps/<mapname>.txt` for singleplayer and listen server host.
    * They are located in `garrysmod/download/data/splashsweps/<mapname>.txt` for multiplayer games.
    * There are also `garrysmod/data/splashsweps/<mapname>_lightmap.png`.  
      If you see strange shading for the ink, try removing them.
* The ink surface doesn't support multiple light styles on a map.

Using an external addon for third person view is also recommended.
